PiSrv
=====

Serves some lovely files on the Raspberry Pi, mmm Pi..

=====

This application demonstrates a simple TCP/IP socket server that recieves data from clients that have passed a loose protocol.
When files are sent, they are 'stamped' with the time it took to recieve the entire file, and are renamed with the correct name & extension as described in the object file.
PiSrv was used in conjunction with a seperate client.
